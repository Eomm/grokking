 * Complexity: O(log exponent)
 *
 * In strong cryptography, b is often at least 1024 bits.[1] Consider b = 5 Ã— 1076 and e = 17,
 * both of which are perfectly reasonable values. In this example, b is 77 digits in length and
 * e is 2 digits in length, but the value be is 1,304 decimal digits in length. S
 * uch calculations are possible on modern computers, but the sheer magnitude of such numbers causes
 * the speed of calculations to slow considerably. As b and e increase even further to provide
 * better security, the value be becomes unwieldy.
